# Crop Simulator Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Cannot Change Size of Crop Area**

- **Problem**: Only the bottom-right corner handle was functional for resizing
- **Solution**: Added all 8 resize handles (4 corners + 4 edges) with proper functionality
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `resize-nw`, `resize-ne`, `resize-sw`, `resize-se` for corner handles
  - Added `resize-n`, `resize-s`, `resize-w`, `resize-e` for edge handles
  - Updated mouse handling logic to support all resize directions

### 2. ✅ **Cannot Change Direction of Crop Area**

- **Problem**: Crop area could only be resized in one direction (bottom-right)
- **Solution**: Implemented multi-directional resize with proper cursor indicators
- **Implementation**:
  - Each corner handle resizes in its respective direction
  - Edge handles resize only in the perpendicular direction
  - Proper cursor styles for each resize direction (`nw-resize`, `ne-resize`, etc.)

### 3. ✅ **Dim Area Outside Crop Selection**

- **Problem**: The overlay was a uniform dark layer, not highlighting the crop area
- **Solution**: Implemented precise dimming overlay that only covers areas outside crop selection
- **Implementation**:
  - Created 4 separate overlay divs: top, bottom, left, right
  - Each overlay covers only the area outside the crop selection
  - Crop area remains bright and visible with proper contrast

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Resize Functionality

```typescript
// Added support for all 8 resize directions
const [dragMode, setDragMode] = useState<
  | 'move'
  | 'resize-nw'
  | 'resize-ne'
  | 'resize-sw'
  | 'resize-se'
  | 'resize-n'
  | 'resize-s'
  | 'resize-w'
  | 'resize-e'
  | null
>(null);
```

### Improved Mouse Handling

- **Drag Start Tracking**: Added `dragStart` state to track initial mouse position
- **Direction-Specific Logic**: Each resize direction has its own calculation logic
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Maintains aspect ratio constraints during resize
- **Boundary Checking**: Prevents crop area from going outside container bounds

### Precise Dimming Overlay

```typescript
// Four separate overlays for precise dimming
<div className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none">
  {/* Top overlay */}
  <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 bg-black/60"
       style={{ height: `${cropArea.y}px` }} />
  {/* Bottom, left, right overlays... */}
</div>
```

## Features Now Working

### ✅ **Full Resize Control**

- All 8 resize handles are functional
- Corner handles resize diagonally
- Edge handles resize in single direction
- Proper cursor feedback for each handle

### ✅ **Visual Feedback**

- Dimmed overlay outside crop area
- Bright crop area with clear boundaries
- Grid overlay for composition assistance
- Real-time dimension display

### ✅ **Aspect Ratio Support**

- Maintains aspect ratio when preset is selected
- Free-form resizing when no preset is active
- Intelligent constraint application during resize

### ✅ **User Experience**

- Smooth drag-and-drop interaction
- Visual cursor changes for different resize modes
- Clear distinction between crop area and dimmed regions
- Professional photography workflow support

## Testing Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ All resize handles functional
- ✅ Dimming overlay working correctly
- ✅ Aspect ratio constraints applied properly
- ✅ Boundary checking prevents overflow
- ✅ Smooth user interaction

## Next Steps

The crop simulator is now fully functional with all requested features:

1. **Resizable crop area** - All 8 handles work correctly
2. **Multi-directional resize** - Can resize in any direction
3. **Dimmed overlay** - Areas outside crop selection are properly dimmed

The crop simulator is ready for production use and provides a professional-grade cropping experience with industry-standard features.
